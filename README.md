# Space Station Project

## Compilation
    Compile by doing "javac Main.java" then execute by doing "java Main" in the command line.

## Use
    The program is a GUI simulation of the interior of a space station, overlooking several asteroids and
    spaceships. There is a black screen in the middle along with different objects moving around mthe screen.
    There are several buttons and widgets in the border regions that do various things, like
    allowing you to click and slide them, and they will each print out a message on the console. Along with
    this, the "LAUNCH" button allows the user to create a vehicle of their own choosing and display it on
    the window. There are also buttons called "STOP" and "START" that stop or start the animation. The user
    can select an object by clicking on it, then change its color using the "CHANGE COLOR" button. When the
    size of the GUI becomes small enough, the widgets at the bottom change into a button called "LAUNCH" that
    displays a popup window that contains the widgets for launching a new vehicle. The user can also now
    zoom in and out using the buttons on the right side of the screen.

## Rules for Players:
    Your objective is to get as many points as possible. When you are able to change a spaceship or robot's
    color to be gray by using the CHANGE COLOR button, the vehicle will then be able to pass through an
    asteroid without getting destroyed. During the entire time the vehicle passes through an asteroid, your
    points will increase. But if you are not able to change the color of a vehicle in time and it crashes
    into an asteroid, or if two of your vehicles crash, you will lose 20 points each time, and if your points
    go below 0, it's game over! You can add spaceships or robots using the commands at the bottom. Asteroids
    will continuously appear at random, so be careful!
